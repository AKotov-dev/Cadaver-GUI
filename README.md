# Cadaver-GUI
GUI for cadaver - a command-line WebDAV client

+ Copies files (you can select Ctrl+Mouse) from the computer to the cloud and back
+ Creates directories, renames/deletes directories/files in the cloud
+ Copying directories `cadaver` does not understand, only `files`

**Dependencies:** gtk2 cadaver

After launching, click the `Gear` and enter the `Server` (you can choose from the list), `Login` (for example, this is mail) and `Password` (for example, Mail.ru - this is the password of external applications).

If there was nothing better at hand, this tool can be useful for sharing work with small files.
